Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room served as the client. For Android, they currently had a game named Draw It or Lose It. The Gaming Room intended to extend to new platforms and enhance the software's functionality.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
One thing that I did well when developing this documentation was kept the document informational, but clear and concise so that it is easy to understand.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It helps you maintain your attention and determine what tasks require time and focus and which ones don't.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
To be honest, I'm not sure of which part, as each part seems to aid in the development of Draw it or Lose It.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I helped divide the game's functionality such that porting it to different operating systems would need less time and effort. all the while keeping the game the same.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I put my focus on clear documentation and seperating game and game needs functionality to allow easier updates and maintenence.
